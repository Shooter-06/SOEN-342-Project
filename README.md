# SOEN 342 – Software Requirements and Deployment

Project – Iteration 1

<h2> SOEN 342: Software Requirements and Deployment Objective </h2>
The project will be developed incrementally over 3–4 iterations, following the formal software engineering process taught in the course.

## :dart: Iteration 1 Objectives
In this iteration, our tasks are to create the following:
1. Use-case diagram, including critical and non-critical use-cases.
2. UML domain model
3. System sequence diagram(s) to capture success and failure scenarios for critical usecases.
4. One fully-dressed scenario for a critical use-case, with at least one success and one
failure case (equivalent system sequence diagram to be provided in the above).
5. Identification of system operations and operation contracts.
